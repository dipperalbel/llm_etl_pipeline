"""
Public API for the `extraction` subpackage.

This module exposes core data structures (like Document, Paragraph, Sentence),
LLM-related functionalities (LocalLLM), PDF conversion tools (PdfConverter),
and specific extraction utilities (e.g., MonetaryInformation, ConsortiumComposition,
and functions like get_filtered_fully_general_series_call_pdfs).

It centralizes imports from various internal modules within the `extraction`
package to provide a clean and accessible interface for external use.
